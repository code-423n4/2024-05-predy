what in scope contract inherits   abstract ``BaseMarket`` ??  only the  `` BaseMarketUpgradable``  is inherited  by   ``PerpMarketV1`` &  ``GammaTradeMarket``


[05/25/2024 12:55] syuhei.
BaseMarket is the immutable version of BaseMarketUpgradable, but there are no contracts that inherit from BaseMarket now. The same can be said about BaseHookCallback.

Is there any resource that explains how the formulas of "The Relationship between the Value of Uniswap V3 LP Position and the square root of the price
" where driven and the logic behind them @syuhei


[05/26/2024 00:55] syuhei.
I believe formula (10) from this paper will be helpful: 
"The Replicating Portfolio of a Constant Product Market with Bounded Liquidity, Joseph Clark" https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3898384

when you say "By holding both state (1) and state (4) simultaneously, it is possible to create a state with a value of 2√x." its unclear what you are reffering to as state 1 and 4 and what do you mean by state @syuhei https://docs.predy.finance/predy-v6/dev/squart

[05/26/2024 13:20] neo_granicen
also what are you referring to by state (3) and (5)


[05/26/2024 13:34] syuhei.
It would be more accurate to refer to this as an "equation" rather than a "state." Additionally, there are a few errors in the current equation. I will revise the document accordingly. thank you.
What we want to achieve here is to add equation 4 (the position arising from borrowing and lending tokens from a lending pool) to equation 1 (the value of the LP Position in Uniswap V3) in order to create a position with a value of 2√x.


[05/26/2024 13:41] neo_granicen
is the error also present in the code so that i can check the right equation


[05/26/2024 13:41] neo_granicen
and is there an error with the first part because i see that the x is missing

{Reactions}
👍 

[05/26/2024 13:48] syuhei.
The problem exists only in the document. Equation (5) is missing the x, and equation (4) itself is slightly incorrect.


[05/26/2024 14:16] neo_granicen
can you tell me the problem with equation 4 so that i can continur reading the document and by the way i dont see that 4 is an eqaution it just explain how to cacultate the real reserves its 2 equations


[05/26/2024 14:48] syuhei.
yes. what should have been written in (4) is actually:

Squart = (1) + (4) = LP Position Value + asset/liability

Therefore, (4) represents the asset/liability.
I have revised the document accordingly.
https://docs.predy.finance/predy-v6/dev/squart


[05/26/2024 15:00] neo_granicen
thank you for the effort but I still don't get what (4) is and how we came up with it and what you want to represent by it you said a lending pool but what lending pool aren't we here talking about liquidity @syuhei


[05/26/2024 15:15] syuhei.
What we aim to do here is to create Squart from the LP position.
The necessary asset/liability to create Squart is represented by equation (4). Therefore, it might be better to write it this way.
(4) = (2√x) - (1)


[05/26/2024 15:53] neo_granicen
ahh like this its a lot better but you dont need to change the naming for people will get condused with the quations that represents the real reserve

Go through this article I hope it will help you to understand how options contract works with uniV3


[05/27/2024 15:15] neo_granicen
but just wanted to know is squart an option its said that its a perpetual feature that is similar to options in that it has gamma exposure


[05/27/2024 15:20] syuhei.
Squart differs from options in that it does not have a strike price. To maintain the value of Squart at √x, the underlying Uniswap LP positions are rebalanced. We refer to this process as Reallocation.

{Reactions}
👍 

[05/27/2024 16:26] neo_granicen
so instead of trying to maintain the contract price to the underlying price here you try to maintain it to the square root of x and you use Lp reallocation instead of a funding rate. @syuhei


[05/28/2024 00:25] syuhei.
yes, right.
It might be misleading that the document refers to "perpetual future." Indeed, perpetual futures adjust the contract price using a funding rate. However, Predy does not use a funding rate to track the price.

no anyone can't remove pair.


[05/29/2024 11:57] pxng0lin
So once the max is reached, then what?


[05/29/2024 12:04] syuhei.
I think it should be fine since it's a uint256. If it reach max, we would deploy a different contract. However, if the gas fees are very low, there is a possibility of malicious behavior to add many pairs.

What is  `feeRatio` ?


[05/30/2024 02:01] syuhei.
The feeRatio is the percentage of the fee. For example, if the feeRatio is 10%, 10% of the borrowing interest is collected as a fee. Half of this, 5%, goes to the protocol, and the other half, 5%, goes to the pool creator.

@syuhei I would be grateful if you answer my previous questions first.
Also, my other question is that if you expect that in the future any user can create a new pair, then the `onlyOperator` modifier of  `registerPair` function is temporary and we should not consider it in the review? Because currently, despite this modifier, not everyone can create a new pair.


[05/30/2024 07:06] syuhei.
yes.


[05/30/2024 07:10] syuhei.
Yes, the onlyOperator modifier is temporary. For the contest, please assume that anyone can add pairs.

[05/30/2024 09:33] kapitankalbasa
gamma measures the rate at which an option's delta changes as the underlying asset moves. It's like knowing how fast the toy car's price will change if the price of plastic changes faster or slower.

Hey guys, can someone tell me if I understand the vault correctly, please. Every trader has it's own vault where he deposits initial quote tokens that he can use for trading. This helps because it eliminates the gas fees of transaction because you make only 1 vault that you can fill instead of making a new transaction for every trade and the collateral that you chose will be taken from your vault.

Is this how it is supposed to work?


[05/31/2024 11:04] 0xeeyore
Nop. 

User can have multiple vaults, vault is like a place where you store margin for you open position (Perp or Gamma). With current code you don't deposit collateral directly to the Vault but this can be done via callback functions (predySettlementCallback or predyTradeAfterCallback), you can also transfer directly if you build your own Market contract.

The idea in Predy about no gas fees is build-in in the market contracts (Prep and Gamma) where they are using Permit2 and a special service called Filler. It is the Filler how perform user transaction based on user signed Permit2 tx.

Can someone explain how the perp trading works with the uni v3 or it doesn't. I'm really confused with this.


[05/31/2024 12:26] cholakovv
I believe perp trading works with uniswap v3 using Squart. Squart is fully covered by Uniswap V3 LP positions


[05/31/2024 12:26] cholakovv
you can check this section of the docs https://docs.predy.finance/predy-v6/dev/squart


[05/31/2024 12:35] anmol.eth
Thanks. Maybe i'm not getting the point here. Currently  there are two market perpMarket and gammaMarket. I thought gamma market is supposed to work using uniswap with squart and the perpMarket is like a normal perp where it uses predyPool for leverage. Am i missing a lot of things here?


[05/31/2024 12:54] 0xeeyore
Nop. Squart is only used for Gamma.


[05/31/2024 12:57] 0xeeyore
It is quite easy, you provide collateral in form of quote token. For example USDC. You want to short ETH.

You borrow from PredyPool an ETH and that ETH is sold via UniswapV3 for additional USDC, your voult is holding USDC + debt of ETH. 

If ETH will go up and the margin of you USDC will not be sufficient then all the USDC accounted in voult + margin is used to buyback ETH and you are liquidated.
If ETH will go down you got your profit, you repay your debt by buying back ETH and closing position.

[05/31/2024 12:59] 0xeeyore
UniV3 is only used as a DEX for trading and the source of the token price most of the time in the Perp trading, and for the Perp trading to work users needs to provide liquidity to the PredyPool.


[05/31/2024 13:03] kapitankalbasa
I think there is a mistake in the docs the  = symbol is not necessary in this equation  
R=Base+KinkRate⋅Slope1+(U−KinkRate)⋅Slope2 (U≥KinkRate)


[05/31/2024 13:03] kapitankalbasa
because the result are the same in both equations is the u == kinkRate

Check out `Perp::updateFeeAndPremiumGrowth()`, this function will probably clear up the matter for you


[06/03/2024 07:58] anmol.eth
I'm kinda confused here. For squart  I understand that the pricing (fee) is based  on the uniswap trading fee at the particular ticks. But for simple perp is that a same or we take interest(fee) based on utilization without consulting uniswap fee growth ?


[06/03/2024 14:09] wanziskata

@syuhei i have a question for a pair id lets say eth/usdc ..... is eth strictly the base and usdc strictly the quote token


[06/04/2024 04:50] 0xabhay.
yes you are right


[06/04/2024 04:51] web3tycoon
so in other word there will be anothe pair id for usdc/eth


[06/04/2024 04:51] web3tycoon
@0xabhay  pair 1 = eth/usdc and another pair 30 = usdc/eth??


[06/04/2024 04:54] 0xabhay.
each pair can have a unique ID even if they're the same pair, like ETH/USDC. So, you could have pair ID 1 for "ETH/USDC" and pair ID 2 for "ETH/USDC" as well. Does that clarify things?


[06/04/2024 04:54] 0xabhay.
yes

[06/04/2024 08:47] web3tycoon
what in general is trying to be achieved by `reallocation()` what is the main idea


[06/04/2024 08:51] kombainera
@web3Tycoon  I think this is made so when the price in uniswap v3 goes to a different tick range, they reallocate the predy pool liquidity to the correct tick range so the LP providers keep earning yield

[06/04/2024 08:52] web3tycoon
so in simple terms ur just a liquidity providier for uniswap pairs.. but automatically aiming for the range..

{Reactions}
✅ 

[06/04/2024 08:53] kombainera
If you are a LP only you just supply liquidity to the Predy pool and the protocol automatically just reallocate it always in the tick range where the price is so you keep earning yield


[06/04/2024 08:54] kombainera
This is how I understand it, someone correct me if I am wrong


[06/04/2024 10:04] .nnez
It is actually to maintain the value of Squart at 2xsqrt{x} where x = price of base in term of quote

Hi, the recent addition of "anyone can freely add pairs to the PredyPool" might be causing some confusion. Let me clarify as follows:

It is interpreted as: "Anyone can freely add pairs to the PredyPool; however, the audit scope is limited to cases where WETH, USDC, ARB, USDT, DAI, WBTC are added as pairs."

It is particularly important to ensure that adding new pairs does not introduce vulnerabilities that could lead to the funds of existing pairs being drained.

do you mean as spot trade?


[06/09/2024 03:39] izuman
Yes, considering both are spot trades


[06/09/2024 04:04] .nnez
I don't think it's exactly the same as the spot market.
In spot market you exchange your quote token for base token and you actually hold those base token.
Perp market, you hold perp contract. Base token is actually held by vault on PredyPool and it can still get liquidated


[06/09/2024 06:30] izuman
I think I understand, but now I am wondering what the benefit is from just directly performing a UniSwap trade.  I see the point for perpetuals etc

the msg.sender will be the address in Contract A, bc smart contract calls maintain the original caller throughout the chain.

How did you get this yet no sr role?


[06/15/2024 09:17] daniel526
more are on Validation repo


[06/17/2024 16:48] golomp3761
Hi this was my first contest, is there any validation period where judge will ask me about some more details regarding the vulnerability?


[06/17/2024 21:09] 0xrobocop
During the judging phase, the judge might ask you for some input. If not, you will need to wait to post-judging QA but this is only open if you have the sr role.


[06/17/2024 21:10] golomp3761
How he will Ask me? Will he use Discord?


[06/17/2024 21:33] 0xrobocop
Yeah, staff will reach to you via discord.

@syuhei I know the contest is over, but can you please check out my latest private thread? Thank you✌️


[06/20/2024 07:27] izuman
I would like to know this as well


[06/20/2024 09:17] forgebyola
Judging has been on


[06/20/2024 11:14] izuman
@forgebyola this is my first time and I read that I cannot watch the judging process and don't have a chance for appeals. How will I know if all my submissions are invalidated?


[06/20/2024 11:43] bigsam0831
All submissions will be made public after some weeks


[06/20/2024 11:58] izuman
Got, so it will look something like this?

once the github repo is public, these are only selected for report submissions


[06/20/2024 19:27] joshuajee
Any idea on when the Judging will be completed?


[06/20/2024 19:35] forgebyola

Hi!

I started the process to certify my identity with Provenance about a week ago and today my application has been approved by them. Please make sure that my findings are taken into consideration for this contest (i.e. the identity certification process doesn't impend that).

Thank you very much!


[06/21/2024 14:08] bigsam0831
You have nothing to worry about bro. I wish you the very best, welcome.

I'm not very familiar with the current rules. If I want to escalate my submission twice, at what stage and in what manner should I proceed ?


[06/24/2024 10:16] cloudellie
Suggest you ask this in the #⭐・sr channel


[06/25/2024 14:01] .nnez

Hi @thebrittfactor | C4 @sock @Jay | C4 

I have one selected for report issue with another duplicate issue. 

How is that $20?


[07/08/2024 21:17] josephdara
With 4 highs and 8 mediums total issues in a 79k H/M pool

Something is odd


[07/08/2024 21:22] thebrittfactor
Creating a private thread to discuss.


[07/08/2024 21:23] saint6704
@thebrittfactor | C4 even we had one selected for report issue 
And that's pretty less
Our team found 5/12 issues


[07/08/2024 21:28] thebrittfactor
Please note there were a fair amount of duplicates for these issues, which will lessen the slice/award amounts.


[07/09/2024 05:26] welith
where can we see the submissions? This was my first c4 competition and I'm still getting my way around the platform (I can see my name in the post above)


[07/09/2024 05:30] wanziskata
you have to wait for the final report. In order to see the results early, you need the SR role

Hi @thebrittfactor | C4 , it is my first contest as well. If I don't find my name in the list does that mean that none of my submissions were validated?
Waiting for the final report

Wow, I can't believe my first reward in the first contest I participated in. Although the reward is small, I am very happy 😍

@Jay | C4  Are the rewards distributed into wallets? Because nothing has been deposited on my wallet yet


[07/31/2024 13:46] itsmetechjay
Yes they are sent on Polygon wallets.  If you didn't receive it, can you open a [help desk request](https://code4rena.com/help) please and we can take a look.
